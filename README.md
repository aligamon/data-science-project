# Data Science Projects

In my data science project on diabetes and stroke prediction, I sought to develop a model that could accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes and stroke respectively based on various risk factors. To do this, I downloaded a dataset from kaggle and it's dependent variable determines if the patient has diabetes or not. I used machine learning algorithms to train a model on the data. After testing and evaluating the model, I found that it was able to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes using Random Forest, XGBoost and LGBMClassifier.	

Biodiversity and Melbourne housing projects focus more towards data cleaning and data visualisation using matplotlib and seaborn
